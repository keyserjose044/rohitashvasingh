    <div class="mb-12">
      <p class="text-lg mb-6">
        My research focuses on the design and optimization of
        nano-reinforced and low-carbon cementitious materials for
        sustainable and resilient infrastructure. By tailoring the
        nano- and micro-scale structure of the cementitious matrix, I
        aim to control early-age rheology while enhancing long-term
        mechanical performance and durability.
      </p>
      <p class="text-lg mb-6">
        I work at the intersection of materials science and structural
        engineering, combining multiscale experimental testing with
        advanced characterization techniques (SEM–EDS, XRD, FTIR,
        Raman, AFM–QNM/nano-IR, nano-CT, calorimetry, TGA, rheometry).
        This approach enables a fundamental understanding of how SCMs,
        nanomaterials, and hybrid fiber systems modify the
        microstructure of cementitious binders and translate into
        improved toughness, stiffness, and resistance to deterioration
        mechanisms such as alkali–silica reaction (ASR).

    <p class="text-lg mb-6">
      The overarching goal of my work is to enable the next generation
      of high-performance, low-carbon concrete systems. By combining
      SCMs, nanomaterials, and multiscale characterization, my research
      provides mechanistic insight and practical mix-design strategies
      that can be translated into structural applications. This includes
      concretes with significantly enhanced toughness and stiffness,
      mixtures that mitigate ASR while retaining mechanical performance,
      and binder systems that contribute to meaningful reductions in the
      carbon footprint of infrastructure without compromising safety
      or service life.
